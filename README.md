# Personal Portfolio Website (Akshay Lende)

🌟 Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for a responsive, single-page professional portfolio website. It is designed to showcase skills, academics, experience, and personal projects in a clean, modern interface, serving as a dynamic online resume.

The design utilizes a persistent sidebar for contact information and a dynamic main content area with section-based navigation.

✨ Features

Responsive Layout: Optimized for display on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Static Sidebar: Displays key contact information, social links, and a profile image.

Segmented Navigation: Utilizes a navigation bar to switch between different content views without page reloads:

About: Self-introduction and core competencies.

Skills: Technical skills with proficiency bars (C/C++, Python, SQL, etc.).

Academics: Detailed education history, courses, and certifications.

Experience: Professional timeline detailing roles and contributions.

Projects: Showcase of personal and academic projects (e.g., Qwitter App, Magical Arena).

Contact: A functional contact form template (requires a backend integration for submission).

Language Showcase: Dedicated section in the "About" page listing major programming languages with icons.

Iconography: Uses Ionicons for a modern and clean aesthetic.

💻 Technology Stack

This project is built using standard web technologies for a lightweight, fast, and easy-to-deploy static site:

HTML5: Semantic structure and content organization.

CSS: Custom styling (inferred from the linked style.css) for layout, aesthetics, and responsiveness.

JavaScript: JavaScript (inferred from script.js) for interactive elements, such as the sidebar toggle (data-sidebar-btn) and page navigation logic (data-nav-link).

External Assets:

Google Fonts: Poppins typeface for typography.

Ionicons: Used for all decorative and functional icons.

Devicon: Used for language/technology icons (e.g., C++, Python).

📂 Project Structure

Although the primary file is index.html, the structure relies on external assets, organized as follows:
```bash
portfolio-website/
├── index.html            # Main structure and content
└── assets/
    ├── css/
    │   └── style.css     # All custom CSS styles (inferred)
    ├── js/
    │   └── script.js     # All JavaScript logic for navigation and interactivity (inferred)
    └── images/
        └── DSC02926.JPG  # Profile picture

```

⚙️ Setup and Deployment

Running Locally

This is a static site and does not require a complex server setup.

Clone the repository:
```
git clone "https://github.com/Akshaylende/Portfolio/"
cd portfolio
```

Open the file: Simply open the index.html file in your web browser.


Update all personal details (name, contact info, social links, and section content) within index.html.

Modify the styling in assets/css/style.css for custom colors or layout adjustments.

Implement the backend logic for the contact form in the Contact section (the current HTML only provides the frontend structure).
